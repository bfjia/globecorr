Ordering of domains and correlation links can now be controlled.
A dropdown is now available in the visualization control panel.
The options are "Document order" which orders as provided in the data document.
The domains are ordered in the order they are encountered in the either var1_domain and var2_domain fields.
The original ordering is "Domain size" which sorts the domains based on size.
Ordering starts from the 12 o'clock position.
