GlobeCorr is a data visualization software developed to facilitate the viewing and analysis of multiple correlation datasets. To enable further, dynamic exploration of your data, users can upload a table of correlations in csv format and GlobeCorr provides an interactive and customizable “globe-based” visualization.  

This software and website has been developed by the [Brinkman Lab](https://www.brinkman.mbb.sfu.ca/) at Simon Fraser University, Canada. Please [contact us](/acknowledgements) with any questions. 

To explore GlobeCorr, you can download one of our [sample datasets](/sample_small.csv), view the correlation globe [directly](/globe?view=%2Fsample_small.csv), or read our [tutorial](/tutorial) for more information.
