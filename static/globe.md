Upload your csv of pre computed pairwise correlations. To avoid domain names being cut off, we recommend using short domain names. 

By default, all correlations are shown. Red ribbons represent negative correlations, while blue represent positive. 

Use the blue bar to the right of the screen to customize the view, including the correlation threshold, and colors of correlation ribbons. Customizations can be saved using "Quick Settings".
