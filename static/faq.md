# FAQ
**Why is my image not rendering**  
 If you are using other file formats, such as .xlms, .xlsx or .txt the image will not render. Please convert the file to .csv and consult the [tutorial](https://globecorr.ca/tutorial) for further instructions. 

**Will my image not generate if I have more than 5 columns.**  
 As long as the data in the first 5 columns is as specified in the [tutorial](https://globecorr.ca/tutorial) then the image will render and the additional columns will be ignored.
