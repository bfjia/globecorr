# FAQ
**What input file format do I need to use?**  
GlobeCorr takes csv files. If you are using other file formats, such as .xlms, .xlsx or .txt the image will not render. Please convert the file to .csv and consult the [tutorial](/tutorial) for further instructions. 

**Will my image not generate if I have more than 5 columns?**  
 As long as the data in the first 5 columns is as specified in the [tutorial](/tutorial) then the image will render and the additional columns will be ignored.
