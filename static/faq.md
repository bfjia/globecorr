**What input file format do I need to use?**  
GlobeCorr takes csv files. If you are using other file formats, such as .xlms, .xlsx or .txt the image will not render. Please convert the file to .csv and consult the [tutorial](/tutorial) for further instructions. 

**Will my image not generate if I have more than 5 columns?**  
 As long as the data in the first 5 columns is as specified in the [tutorial](/tutorial) then the image will render and the additional columns will be ignored. 

**The domain labels are cut off in my image, what can I do to fix this?**  
This can depend on the size of the your screen. We are currenty working to get the diagram to render relative to the screen size of the user. However, it is best practice to avoid long domain names.
