# Tutorial 
Please see our [About]() and [FAQ]() for more information.  


## **1. Upload your data**

To upload data, click the `Upload data to visualize` bar at the top of the page. 

GlobeCorr requires a 5 column dataset in .csv format. If you would like an example, feel free to download one of our [sample datasets](). 

  + Column 1: Variable Name 1
  + Column 2: Domain of Variable 1
  + Column 3: Variable Name 2
  + Column 4: Domain of Variable 2
  + Column 5: Correlation Coefficient 

After loading your data, the image will render automatically. 

## **2. Customize your view**

**Change what correlations are shown** 

- Change the correlation threshold for the globe by hovering over the `Globe Options` menu on the right hand side of the screen. Use the slider to select your desired threshold. The visualization will update automatically. 

- To remove domains from the visualization, click on its location at the circumference. The correlation ribbons will disappear, but a small grey box will remain at the circumference representing the hidden domain should the user want to include those correlations again. 

- To explore all correlations within a specific domain, hover over the domain on the circumference of the circle and all correlations within that domain will go from transparent to opaque. 

- To explore specific correlations, hover over the ribbons on the interior of the circle to see the variable and their corresponding correlation coefficient. 

**Layout and colouring**

- The orientation of the domains around the circumference of the circle can be changed by clicking the domain and dragging. 

- To update the colour of the ribbons shown in the globe, hover over the ` Globe Options` menu on the right hand side of the screen. To change the colours for positive corrlations, click `Positive Correlation Colour`. You can select using the slider or by selecting a colour on the palette. The colour will change automatically. The user can also specify opacity using the bottom slider. To change the colours for negative corrlations, click `Negative Correlation Colour`. You can select using the slider or by selecting a colour on the palette. The colour will change automatically.The user can also specify opacity using the bottom slider.

<!-- ## **3. Save your results** 

- To save the image, click the `...` icon on the right hand side. Hover over the `image` button to see available options for image export. After clicking on the desired output format, the image will download automatically. 

- To save the data, click the `...` icon on the right side. Hover over the `data` button to see available options for data export. After clicking on the desired output format, the data will download automatically. The data contained within this download will only be what is shown in the current rendering of the visualization. So if a correlation threshold has been set to exclude some data, the user will download a subset of the data. 

- To send the image directly to the printer click the `...` icon on the right side. Click the `print` button and then follow the instructions for your printer.  -->
