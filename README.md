# GlobeCorr

GlobeCorr.ca is a web based application designed to provide user-friendly, secure, interactive visualization and analysis of correlation datasets. Users load tabular data listing pairwise variables and their correlation values, and GlobeCorr creates a dynamic visualization using ribbons to represent positive and negative correlations, optionally grouped by domain/category (such as microbiome taxa vs other metadata). GlobeCorr provides a simple method for users to visualize and identify potential confounders and summarize complex datasets. This tool is applicable to a wide range of disciplines and domains of interest, including for the bioinformatics/microbiome and metadata examples provided.
